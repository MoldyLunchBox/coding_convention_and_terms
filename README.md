##to put it simply, "ich vergesse", i forget, i find it difficult to remember all the terms and what things are called, so i'm keeping notes here

#Spread operator:

``
// Example array
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];

// Spread operator used to create a new array with additional elements
const newArray = [...myArray, 4, 5];

console.log(newArray);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
